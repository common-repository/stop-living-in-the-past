== Description ==

Do your part to help phase out Internet Explorer 6 forever by adding a warning to your blog or site that tells visitors using Internet Explorer 6 or older that they need to upgrade to the current version right now.

The plugin inserts a 800px wide blue box with the following warning text:

"Your browser is outdated. Stop living in the past and upgrade!
You are using the long outdated Internet Explorer 6 browser. This site may not display or work correctly and you are 
putting your data and privacy at risk. To get the most out of the web, upgrade to the newest version of Internet Explorer
right now. If you are at work and you see this message, talk to your IT department and ask them to upgrade the browser to 
secure your company data."

The text contains two links, one directly to the Internet Explorer download page hosted by Microsoft.com and the other to 
the StopLivingInThePast.com website where visitors can get further information about the campaign and download this plugin.
	
The warning box is triggered by basic JavaScript and contains strict validated CSS and HTML. It is completely self-contained
and will only show up if the visitor uses IE6. The plugin is designed in such a way that other than inserting the box 
at the top of the page it will not interfere with the content of your site.

== Installation ==

1. Upload StopLivingInThePast.php to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
